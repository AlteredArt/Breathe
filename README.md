# Breathe
Welcome, I hope you are having a great day, if your'e not this could be your solution. 
"Breathe" is a progressive web app designed to help it's users relax in times of high stress, such as interview processes, or work, or daily lives. 
  
This app is deployed and available for anyone to use. 
I designed this app to be used with ease, No signing up or logging in. 
Just visit the site, play a song, and focus on the breathing circles as they guide you to relaxation.
